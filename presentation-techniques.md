If we can't explain our **vision** in the first 5 minutes of our presentation, we've already lost our audience. 

**Vision** : is an issue that someone cares about, as well as something novel in our approach. The problem/issue is understanding the nature of human intellect, and the approach is to explore questions about what distinguishes humans from Chimpanzees and Neanderthals. The conclusion is that because humans are symbolic beings, we can construct symbolic descriptions of relationships and events by stringing them together to form tales/narratives. 

**Ideas/Views** : Our views are similar to our children. And we don't want them to go about in rags. As a result, we have these approaches, ideas, and systems for presenting them so that they are recognized for the value that they contain.
