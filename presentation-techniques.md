If we can't explain our **vision** in the first 5 minutes of our presentation, we've already lost our audience. **Vision** : is an issue that someone cares about, as well as something novel in our approach.

The conclusion is that because humans are symbolic beings, we can construct symbolic descriptions of relationships and events by stringing them together to form tales/narratives.
